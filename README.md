# Charlie - here for you when you need it.

Charlie is a web-app based on Ruby on Rails, which helps you soothe yourself during paniattacks. Upon opening the app (without login) an animated ball appears, which simulates the correct pace for a soothing cycle of breath. Thus,  you will be able to soothe yourself during anxiety- or panicattacks.

## Features
* With a built-in SMS Messenger (Twilio) you can easily reach out to loved ones, sending a pre-defined message. After creating an account and saving phonenumbers of your most trusted persons, you will be able to click on the `GET HELP` button and send a pre-defined message. This feature ensures the minimalist usability, to help you focus on getting better fast.
* On the Dashboard you can find your statistics, which can help you identify your most stressful days, as the app tracks the amount of times you opened the Homepage.

## Background

The app was built as a final project during the coding bootcamp of Le Wagon Berlin (Batch 490). Due to the characteristics of the project, some parts of the app are hardcoded (phone numbers) and seeded (statistics page).
